What is Shaker?
###############

Shaker is an asset rollup management tool for Mojito applications which reduces the number of HTTP requests, thus improving performance. 

A rollup consists of one or more input files that are combined (rolled up) to produce a single output file. Rollups can be as simple as a single file, a single mojit binder and its dependencies, or any combination thereof.

Shaker allows you to create rollups using different combination of dimensions. For example, you may want to serve different assets when people are connected from different devices, different countries, etc.


Why Shaker?
###########

Mojito does not have the ability to serve complex rollups. Shaker improves Mojitoâ€™s rollup abilities in many ways.

**Example:** This is how you dynamically add your assets in Mojito, based on some dimension (in this case, the device):

::

	// controller logic
	var device = ac.context.device,
        css = '/static/device/assets/simple';

	if (device === 'iphone') {
		css += '.' + device;
	}

	css += '.css';

	ac.assets.addCss(css, 'top');

**Example:** this is how you dynamically add your assets with **Shaker:**

::

	// No logic to write!
	// Rollups are picked up automatically based on dependencies, context and filenames :)

When dealing with multiple dimensions, the logic that you have to write can quickly become complicated. With Shaker, we do all of this automatically for you. You just put your assets with the right name and Shaker will take care of adding them if needed.


Overall Goals
#############

The overall goal for Shaker is to deploy all client-side assets (such as CSS and JavaScript code), in the most performant way possible. This means serving optimized CSS and JS for every set of contexts (devices, buckets, regions, languages...), minimizing the time and the bandwidth used.

Moreover, this optimization has to be done with no effort by developers (set-and-forget).

Benefits
###############

Simple Conventions
==========================

Following the Shaker conventions greatly simplifies configuring your application to use Shaker.


Powerful Customization
==========================

Shaker allows you to customize your rollups based on any combination of context dimension values. And if desired, rollups can be further customized via powerful options/features.


Set-and-Forget
=======================

Shaker is designed to eliminate the long term costs associated with maintaining a large number of rollups. Once an application is configured to use Shaker, there is nothing left to do from a developer standpoint. Shaker takes care of everything from that point on.

Zero Produtionize work-cost
============================

Once your app is configured properly to use Shaker, you will be able to push to production automatically just invoking shaker on build time to prepare the updated necessary assets
